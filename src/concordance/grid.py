"""Scaffold registry — make the pattern visible.

The 117 axes live in a *multi-dimensional scaffold* with eight members
(encoding, metabolism, reasoning, physical_substance, authority_trust,
time_sequence, conservation_balance, discreteness). Each axis has coordinates
along some subset of those members. Axes that share a member are *adjacent*;
axes that sit on three or more are *structurally deep*. The renders
in this module are flat projections of that scaffold — useful for
reading, but each one collapses dimensions a higher-dimensional view
would preserve.

The mapping is a proposal, not a closed claim. Discovery, not design:
when an axis sits clearly on a member, mark it; when it doesn't,
leave it off. Surface the cluster the data shows; don't force one.

ON THE FLOOR vs the EXTENDED MAP: the 2.0 verification floor consumes ONLY
AXIS_DIMENSIONS and UMBRELLAS (record.axis_coords_for, ledger.find_closest). The
projections, retag/DIMENSION_KIND machinery, MEASURE_AXES/FORCES, and the CLI below
are the EXTENDED MAP — exploration scaffolding, not part of the verification path.
`check_dimension_members()` enforces the floor invariant: every axis sits only on
declared members (a test asserts it; see test_grid).

Run as a CLI (each subcommand is a different projection):
    python -m concordance.grid              # matrix projection
    python -m concordance.grid depth        # axes ranked by member count
    python -m concordance.grid adjacent X   # neighbors on the scaffold
    python -m concordance.grid dimension D  # axes on a single member
