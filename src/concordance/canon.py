canon.py — Tradition-aware biblical canon as a SEPARATE LAYER.

The operator's directive (literal):
  "Treat canon as a separate layer. We don't judge, but we don't include
   disputed books with the 66 books that are not disputed. We show it
   honestly and historically framed. Let the user discern."

So this module models canon as concentric LAYERS, with disputed books kept
strictly SEPARATE from the undisputed core:

  * UNDISPUTED_66       — the Protestant 66, the core all major traditions
                          share. Derived from verifiers/scripture._CANON_BOOKS
                          so there is ONE source of truth for the 66.
  * TRADITION_ADDITIONS — books each tradition adds BEYOND the 66, each with
                          an honest one-line historical frame. The disputed
                          books are never merged into the 66; they are reported
                          on their own layer.

The engine SHOWS who holds what plus the history. It does NOT rule which canon
is "correct" — conduit, not source; it points to Christ, not to itself as an
arbiter (it is not an idol). The map never launders: the historical frames here
are kept factual and the genuine uncertainty in some enumerations (especially
the Ethiopian Tewahedo canon) is flagged honestly rather than overstated.

Sovereign: stdlib-only. No external dependencies.

Usage:
    from concordance_engine import canon
    canon.canon_status("John")     # → in_undisputed_66=True, held_by=["all"]
    canon.canon_status("Tobit")    # → in_undisputed_66=False, held_by=[catholic, ...]
    canon.canon_status("Enoch")    # → in_undisputed_66=False, held_by=[ethiopian_orthodox]
    canon.canon_status("Znope")    # → in_undisputed_66=False, held_by=[]  (likely typo)
